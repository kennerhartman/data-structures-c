# Data Structure Word Problem Using C

## Description <hr>
This is a simple C program that I created to help me better understand data structures in C (as there is no such thing as objects or classes in C).  I created a simple word problem so I would know what I wanted to achieve with this program.  [_See word problem below._](#word-problem-)

<br>

### Compiling and Running Program <hr>

Compiler used: [GNU GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org) <br>

To compile and run the program, <br>

(1) ```git clone https://github.com/kennerhartman/data-structures-c.git```

In the console,

(2) ```gcc helloworld.c```

(3) ```./a.out``` _or_ ```./a.exe```
